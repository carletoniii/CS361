How to REQUEST data:
Make sure RandomPhotoGenerator.py is running and that the folder FinalPhotos is located in the same folder. Enter "1"
into the Request.txt file. This will prompt RandomPhotoGenerator.py to write a filepath string for a random photo in the
PhotoFilename.txt file and clear the Request.txt file. Each time a "1" is entered into the Request.txt file, a new
filepath string will be generated in the PhotoFilename.txt file.

How to RECEIVE data:
Once a "1" has been entered into the Request.txt file, the filepath string can be read from the PhotoFilename.txt file.
To generate a new filepath for a random photo, enter a "1" into the Request.txt file.
